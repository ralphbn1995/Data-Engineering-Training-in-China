## Lab Solutions

### Session 1 — Kafka Cluster Intro

**Folder:** `lab-solutions/session-01-kafka-intro/`

Full corrected code for the lab that spins up a **3-broker Apache Kafka cluster** in KRaft mode (no ZooKeeper) using Docker. Covers:

- Topic creation with 3 partitions and replication factor 3
- CLI produce/consume with key-based partition routing
- Fault tolerance: crash a broker, observe leader re-election, verify no data loss
- Python producer (`kafka-python-ng`) and consumer (`confluent-kafka`)
- Automated fault-tolerance test

**Quick start (Windows):**
```bash
cd lab-solutions/session-01-kafka-intro
docker compose up -d
# then follow the README inside the folder
```

---

### Session 2 — Python Streaming Pipeline

**Folder:** `lab-solutions/session-02-kafka-pipeline/`

Full corrected code for the lab that builds a complete **sensor data streaming pipeline** in Python. Covers:

- Producer with `acks=all`, batching, and gzip compression
- Per-message manual-commit consumer (at-least-once semantics)
- Batch consumer for high-throughput scenarios
- Consumer group scaling and partition rebalancing
- Real-time consumer lag monitoring dashboard
- Offset reset (replay from beginning / skip to latest)

**Quick start (Windows):**
```bash
cd lab-solutions/session-02-kafka-pipeline
docker compose up -d
pip install kafka-python-ng confluent-kafka
python python/producer.py --count 50   # Terminal 1
python python/consumer.py              # Terminal 2
```

---

### Session 3 — Kafka + Spark ETL Pipeline

**Folder:** `lab-solutions/session3-etl-pipeline/`

Full corrected code for the lab that builds a **Kafka → Spark Structured Streaming → Parquet** ETL pipeline processing sensor telemetry in real time. Covers:

- Kafka producer generating temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor events
- Spark Structured Streaming pipeline with 6 stages: Ingest → Parse → Clean → Enrich → Aggregate → Sink
- Anomaly flagging and 5-minute windowed aggregations with watermarks
- Checkpoint-based fault recovery (exactly-once delivery to Parquet)
- Batch pipeline for comparison against the streaming version
- Parquet output reader for inspecting results

**Quick start (Windows):**
```bash
cd lab-solutions/session3-etl-pipeline
docker compose up -d
pip install pyspark==3.5.3 kafka-python-ng confluent-kafka
python python/producer.py            # Terminal 1 — generate sensor events
python python/etl_pipeline.py        # Terminal 2 — run the ETL
python python/read_output.py         # Terminal 3 — inspect Parquet output
```

> See the `README.md` inside the folder for Windows-specific Java and Hadoop setup (`winutils.exe`, `hadoop.dll`).

## Course Materials

The `course-materials/` folder contains PDFs for each session:

- **`session-XX-course-and-practical-work.pdf`** — lecture slides and practical exercises
- **`session-XX-math-foundations-questions.pdf`** — mathematical foundations problem sets

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Required for |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Docker Desktop | 20.10+ | All sessions |
| Docker Compose | v2.0+ | All sessions |
| Python | 3.10+ | All sessions |
| Java (OpenJDK) | 21 | Session 3+ (PySpark) |
| Hadoop binaries (`winutils.exe`, `hadoop.dll`) | 3.3.6 | Session 3+ (Windows only) |

> **Python packages (Sessions 1–2):** `kafka-python-ng >= 2.0.2` and `confluent-kafka >= 2.0.0`  
> **Python packages (Session 3+):** add `pyspark==3.5.3` (3.4.x removed `typing.io`, breaking Python 3.12+)  
> The legacy `kafka-python==2.0.2` crashes on Python 3.12+ — all lab solutions use `kafka-python-ng` instead.
